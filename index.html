            <h3>About Kendra's Yoga and Pilates</h3>
            <h4> A Movement Educator</h4>
            <p>Based in Ontario, Canada and specializing in Yoga, Reformer Pilates and meditation, I call myself a passionate movement educator. I don't just lead a class, but share my knowledge and give you the tools to make better movement choices for yourself. Over the last 8 years, these practices have deeply intertwined with my life, the warmth I discovered in these communities has lead me into guiding vast groups of 200 at outdoor fitness events to cherished intimate sessions.</p>
            <p>Practicing safely, knowing your body and cultivating overall health are the defining features of my teaching style. Life has its trials; an injury early in my fitness journey made me revisit my approach. It underscored the essence of balance, precision, and rest in my regimen. I want all of my students to feel the joy that comes with moving intelligently and cultivating their healthiest self.</p>
            <p>I believe that Yoga, Pilates and Meditation perfectly complement each other on the path to overall health. Working to strengthen, lengthen and create flexibility in the body as well as creating an equanimous and well-balanced mind.</p>

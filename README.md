How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

I built this website with HTML and CSS using a basic template and building up from there, this website has been formatted with Flexbox to allow for more flexibility to the website.  

Lessons Learned:
While challenging myself to use Flexbox more I learned that when you inspect the website in the domain, there is a button that appears beside display: flex that allows you to insert any of the flexbox commands. That feature made it easier to manipulate any objects to orientate them faster. Also learned how to insert an icon using a link instead of an image and how to manipulate the Google icons.
